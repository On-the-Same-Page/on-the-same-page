            The data was obtained from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goodreads website</a>. Goodreads has a database with dozens of millions of books, so we decided to use a list of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/1.Best_Books_Ever" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"the best books ever"</a>, according to the general Goodreads community. We then scraped the top one thousand books from the list, using <a href="https://github.com/havanagrawal/GoodreadsScraper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this scraper</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            We needed some information that was beyond the scope of the scraper, so we coded additional scraping scripts to get those (such as book covers, publication year, a better list of authors etc.). Data was then cleaned, wrangled and shaped to best fit our visualization needs. All that was done with <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>, as well as exploratory data analysis and visualizations prototyping. All code related to these activities are available at our <a href="https://github.com/On-the-Same-Page/data-prep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data-prep repository</a>. The data was last updated on March 12, 2023.
