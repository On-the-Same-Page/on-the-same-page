        <p>We love reading books. In today’s age, many have difficulties finding the right one to get lost in - having too many options can make it hard to make a satisfactory choice. On the Same Page visualizes hundreds of books using a filterable scatterplot and provides detailed information to assist you in your search for the next read! Have fun exploring On the Same Page and maybe you will find your next favorite somewhere in the plot?</p>

        <p>
            The data was obtained from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goodreads website</a>. Goodreads has a database with dozens of millions of books, so we decided to use a list of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/1.Best_Books_Ever" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"the best books ever"</a>, according to the general Goodreads community. We then scraped the top one thousand books from the list, using <a href="https://github.com/havanagrawal/GoodreadsScraper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this scraper</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            We needed some information that was beyond the scope of the scraper, so we coded additional scraping scripts to get those (such as book covers, publication year, a better list of authors etc.). Data was then cleaned, wrangled and shaped to best fit our visualization needs. All that was done with <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>, as well as exploratory data analysis and visualizations prototyping. All code related to these activities are available at our <a href="https://github.com/On-the-Same-Page/data-prep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data-prep repository</a>. You can also explore the <a href="assets/data.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resulting JSON file</a> used in this application. The data was last updated on March 12, 2023.
